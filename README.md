# Dhruv's Projects

Welcome to my GitHub! Here, you'll find a collection of my projects in **robotics** and **web development**.

## üîß Current Projects

### ü¶æ Robotics - ROS2 Development
I am currently working on a robotics project that involves integrating **ROS2** with human detection and joystick control. The system is designed for manual and autonomous navigation, including features like "Follow Me" mode, where the robot can follow a detected person based on camera input.

- **Technologies**: ROS2, Python, OpenCV, YOLOv5, Computer Vision
- **Key Components**:
  - **Human Detection**: Using YOLOv5 for real-time human detection from a camera feed.
  - **Joystick Control**: Manual movement control using a custom joystick node.
  - **Follow Me Mode**: Implemented functionality for the robot to follow a detected person autonomously.

### üåê Web Development - React.js & Next.js
Alongside my robotics work, I am also actively developing web applications using **React.js** and **Next.js**. These projects focus on creating fast, scalable front-end applications.

- **Technologies**: JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js
- **Key Projects**:
  - **Portfolio Website**: Built a responsive, dynamic portfolio using Next.js, featuring my projects and blogs.
  - **E-commerce Platform**: Developed a scalable e-commerce website using React and integrated it with a backend API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++
- **Frameworks**: React.js, Next.js, Node.js
- **Tools**: ROS2, OpenCV, Git, Docker
